Welcome to the Wolfpack Community Localization Project! üåê

## About Wolfpack
Wolfpack is an exciting submarine simulation game that allows players to work together as a crew to operate a submarine during World War II. For more information, check out the [official Wolfpack game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/490920/Wolfpack/).

## Project Overview
Since the release of update 0.26, Wolfpack supports community-created languages. This project aims to create and maintain community-driven translations for Wolfpack in various languages. Our goal is to ensure that players from different countries can enjoy the game in their native language.

## How-To install
I will publish a video with step-by-step instructions as soon as possible
